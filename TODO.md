- remove location connections
- validation error notifications

# nice things
- redesign dialogue screen
- open modal for name when creating a new map
- enable double click for editing lines
- paint walk-set
- make modal changes apply on submit
- copy and paste for background texture sets
- organize and cluster background textures
- prevent placing npcs on taken/non-walkable tiles
- stage direction line nodes

# don't know yet
- allow initial lines as state trigger?
- dialogue state descriptions should probably be unique
