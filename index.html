    <h1>Armchair: The RPG Workshop</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5rem">Feel free to play around with it: <a href="https://my-armchair.com/alpha">https://my-armchair.com/alpha</a>.</p>
    <p>Armchair is currently in alpha.</p>
    <p>Armchair is a program for writing branching interactive dialogue. Typically found in (c)RPGs but you can use it for other types of computer games, too.</p>
    <aside>It only uses cookies or local storage to save your state of the world. No data is ever sent anywhere. I try to keep save-files compatible during the alpha; no guarantees, though.</aside>
